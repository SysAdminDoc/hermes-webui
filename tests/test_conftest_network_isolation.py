"""Adversarial test for the network-isolation fixture in conftest.py.

The autouse module-level monkey-patch in tests/conftest.py wraps
socket.create_connection so that any non-loopback / non-RFC1918 / non-link-local
destination raises OSError. This file proves:

  1. The block actually fires for outbound to a real public IP.
  2. Loopback / RFC1918 / link-local / reserved-TLD destinations pass through.
  3. The `allow_outbound_network` fixture re-enables real network for tests
     that legitimately need it.

Without this enforcement, a test that accidentally calls real outbound
(forgotten mock, leaked credential triggering an SDK initialisation, new
code path bypassing an existing mock) can leak production credentials,
slow the test suite into 10-minute waits on TLS handshakes, and produce
flaky failures depending on whether the destination is reachable.
